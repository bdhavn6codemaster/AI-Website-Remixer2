# 🚀 AI Website Remixer
A context-aware design engine built on a **Samsung Galaxy A14**.

### 🧠 How it Works
This agent uses **Firecrawl** to scrape live site data and **Groq (Llama 3)** to reimagining the UI into themes like Cyberpunk and Solarpunk.

### 📱 Mobile-First Development
I built this entire project using Google Colab on a mobile phone to demonstrate 
that AI engineering is about **API orchestration**, not expensive hardware.
