# 🚀 AI Website Remixer
A context-aware design engine built on a **Samsung Galaxy A14**.

### 🧠 How it Works
This agent uses **Firecrawl** to scrape live site data and **Groq (Llama 3)** to reimagining the UI into themes like Cyberpunk and Solarpunk.

### 📱 Mobile-First Development
I built this entire project using Google Colab on a mobile phone to demonstrate 
that AI engineering is about **API orchestration**, not expensive hardware.

​🧠 Recursive Synthetic Data Pipeline
​I don't just prompt; I build multi-agent orchestration loops to generate high-fidelity training data.

​Architect Agent: Generates complex UI blueprints (Dashboards, Portals).

​QA Agent: Critiques code for accessibility, DRY principles, and UX flaws.

​Lead Dev Agent: Refines the code into "Gold Standard" 

​🛸 Project Spotlight: Mars Colony Logistics

​Live Preview: View the Dashboard

​This dashboard was generated through a Recursive Agentic Loop.

​Challenge: Minimalist-Dark theme for high-stakes Martian logistics.

​Self-Correction: The pipeline identified and fixed "Semantic Voids" and "Fragile Dependencies" found in the initial AI draft.

​Innovation: Built, critiqued, and deployed entirely using a Galaxy A14 mobile device.
