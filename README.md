# 🚀 AI Website Remixer
A context-aware design engine built on a **Samsung Galaxy A14**.

### 🧠 How it Works
This agent uses **Firecrawl** to scrape live site data and **Groq (Llama 3)** to reimagining the UI into themes like Cyberpunk and Solarpunk.

### 📱 Mobile-First Development
I built this entire project using Google Colab on a mobile phone to demonstrate 
that AI engineering is about **API orchestration**, not expensive hardware.

​🧠 Recursive Synthetic Data Pipeline
​I don't just prompt; I build multi-agent orchestration loops to generate high-fidelity training data.
​Architect Agent: Generates complex UI blueprints (Dashboards, Portals).
​QA Agent: Critiques code for accessibility, DRY principles, and UX flaws.
​Lead Dev Agent: Refines the code into "Gold Standard" output.
​Result: A unique, pre-critiqued dataset optimized for fine-tuning.
